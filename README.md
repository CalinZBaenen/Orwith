# Orwith

## What is this `crate`?
This crate, `orwith`, is a Rust crate that turns the word "orwith" into a programmatical concept by abstracting the idea of "and/or" and encapsulating it in an `Option`-like type.

## Why was this `crate` created?
This crate was created as [an example on DEV](https://dev.to/baenencalin/orwith-as-a-programmatical-concept-3eoc) of how something, in particular, a word, could be represented as a type in a programming language; the word I so happened to choose was "orwith".

## What does "orwith" mean?
"Orwith" is a compound of English "or" and English "with".  
The definition can for "orwith" can be found [on DeviantArt, in the post “Def: Orwith”](https://www.deviantart.com/kattytheenby/journal/Def-Orwith-950684792).
